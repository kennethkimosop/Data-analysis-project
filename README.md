**Netflix Movie Data Analysis Project**
_Overview_
This project focuses on analyzing Netflix movie data to uncover trends in movie durations over the years. The analysis includes data cleaning, preprocessing, and visualization using Python's Pandas and Matplotlib libraries.

_Features Explored_
Data Cleaning and Preprocessing: The dataset was cleaned to handle missing values and format inconsistencies. Preprocessing involved converting data types and extracting relevant features for analysis.

_Visualization_: Utilizing Matplotlib, various visualizations were created to explore relationships between movie durations and release years. Scatter plots and color-coded genre distinctions were used to highlight patterns and trends over time.

**Tools and Libraries Used**
_Python:_ I used it for data manipulation and analysis.
Pandas: Data loading, cleaning, and transformation.
Matplotlib: Creating visualizations such as scatter plots to depict trends.
_Insights_
The project aimed to answer questions such as _whether movie durations have changed significantly over recent years_ and _if there are genre-specific patterns in movie durations_. Insights gained from the analysis contribute to understanding trends in Netflix's movie offerings over time.

Future Enhancements
Future iterations of this project could include more advanced analytics, such as _machine learning models_ to predict movie durations based on genre or other features, or exploring additional datasets to enrich the analysis.

Motivation
This analysis was conducted with the goal of gaining practical experience in data analysis techniques while exploring trends in entertainment content, reflecting a broader interest in leveraging data to understand cultural and industry trends.
